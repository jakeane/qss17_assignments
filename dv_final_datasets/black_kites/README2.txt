Data Attributes
These definitions come from the Movebank Attribute Dictionary, available at www.movebank.org/node/2381.

algorithm marked outlier: Identifies events marked as outliers using a user-selected filter algorithm in Movebank. Outliers have the value TRUE.

animal ID: An individual identifier for the animal, provided by the data owner. This identifier can be a ring number, a name, the same as the associated tag ID, etc. If the data owner does not provide an Animal ID, an internal Movebank animal identifier may sometimes be shown.
	example: 91876A, Gary
	same as: individual-local-identifier

attachment type: The way a tag is attached to an animal. Values are chosen from a controlled list:
	collar: The tag is attached by a collar around the animal's neck.
	glue: The tag is attached to the animal using glue.
	harness: The tag is attached to the animal using a harness.
	implant: The tag is placed under the skin of the an animal.
	tape: The tag is attached to the animal using tape.
	other: user specified

deploy off timestamp: The timestamp when the tag deployment ended.
	example: 2009-10-01 12:00:00.000
	format: yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.sss
	units: UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) or GPS time, which is a few leap seconds different from UTC
	same as: deploy off date

deploy on timestamp: The timestamp when the tag deployment started.
	example: 2008-08-30 18:00:00.000
	format: yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.sss
	units: UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) or GPS time, which is a few leap seconds different from UTC
	same as: deploy on date

deployment ID: A unique identifier for the deployment of a tag on animal, provided by the data owner. If the data owner does not provide a Deployment ID, an internal Movebank deployment identifier may sometimes be shown.
	example: Jane-Tag42

event ID: An identifier for the set of information associated with each record or event in a data set. A unique event ID is assigned to every time-location or other time-measurement record in Movebank.
	example: 6340565
	units: none

latitude (decimal degree): The geographic longitude of a location along an animal track as estimated by the processed sensor data. Positive values are east of the Greenwich Meridian, negative values are west of it.
	example: -121.1761111
	units: decimal degrees, WGS84 reference system
	same as: location lat

longitude (decimal degree): The geographic longitude of a location along an animal track as estimated by the processed sensor data. Positive values are east of the Greenwich Meridian, negative values are west of it.
	example: -121.1761111
	units: decimal degrees, WGS84 reference system
	same as: location long

manipulation type: The way in which the animal was manipulated during the deployment. Additional details about the manipulation can be provided using manipulation comments. Values are chosen from a controlled list:
	confined: The animal's movement was restricted to within a defined area.
	none: The animal received no treatment other than the tag attachment.
	relocated: The animal was released from a site other than the one at which it was captured.
	manipulated other: The animal was manipulated in some other way, such as a physiological manipulation.

sensor type: The type of sensor with which data were collected. Values are chosen from a controlled list:
	acceleration: The sensor collects acceleration data.
	accessory measurements: The sensor collects accessory measurements, such as battery voltage.
	Argos Doppler shift: The sensor is using Argos Doppler shift for determining position.
	barometer: The sensor records air or water pressure.
	bird ring: The animal is identified by a ring that has a unique ID.
	GPS: The sensor uses GPS to find location and stores these.
	magnetometer: The sensor records the magnetic field.
	natural mark: The animal is identified by a natural marking.
	radio transmitter: The sensor is a classical radio transmitter.
	solar geolocator: The sensor collects light levels, which are used to determine position (for processed locations).
	solar geolocator raw: The sensor collects light levels, which are used to determine position (for raw light-level measurements).

sex: The sex of the biological individual(s) represented in the Occurrence. Values are from a controlled list:
	m: male
	f: female

study: The name of the study in Movebank in which data are stored.

tag ID: A unique identifier for the tag, provided by the data owner. If the data owner does not provide a tag ID, an internal Movebank tag identifier may sometimes be shown.
	example: 2342, ptt_4532
	same as: tag local identifier

tag manufacturer name: The company or person that produced the tag.
	example: Holohil
	same as: manufacturer

tag mass: The mass of the tag.
	example: 24
	units: grams

tag model: The model of the tag.
	example: T61
	same as: model

tag readout method: The way the data are received from the tag. Values are chosen from a controlled list:
	satellite: Data are transferred via satellite.
	phone network: Data are transferred via a phone network, such as GSM or AMPS.
	other wireless: Data are transferred via another form of wireless data transfer, such as a VHF radio transmitter/receiver.
	tag retrieval: The tag must be physically retrieved in order to obtain the data.

taxon: The scientific name of the species on which the tag was deployed, as defined by the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS, www.itis.gov). If the species name can not be provided, this should be the lowest level taxonomic rank that can be determined and that is used in the ITIS taxonomy. Additional information can be provided using the term taxon detail.
	example: Buteo swainsoni
	same as: species, animal taxon, individual taxon canonical name

timestamp: The date and time a sensor measurement was taken.
	example: 2008-08-14 18:31:00.000
	format: yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.sss
	units: UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) or GPS time, which is a few leap seconds different from UTC

visible: Determines whether an event is visible on the Movebank Search map. Values are calculated automatically, with TRUE indicating the event has not been flagged as an outlier by "algorithm marked outlier", "import marked outlier" or "manually marked outlier", or that user has overridden the results of these outlier attributes using "manually marked valid" = TRUE. Allowed values are TRUE or FALSE.
